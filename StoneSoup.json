    "Stone Soup is an old folk story in which hungry strangers manipulate the local people of a town into sharing their food. In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the fable is also known as axe soup, button soup, nail soup, and wood soup."
  ,"Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making \"stone soup\", which tastes wonderful, although it still needs a little bit of garnish to improve the flavor, which they are missing."
  ,"The villager does not mind parting with a few carrots to help them out, so that gets added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not reached its full potential yet. The villager hands them a little bit of seasoning to help them out. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient."
  ,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: For other uses, see Seasoning (disambiguation). Seasoning is the process of adding salt, herbs, or spices to food to enhance the flavor."
